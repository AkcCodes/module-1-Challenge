## module-1-Challenge
In this project, I went through the HTML file given to me by my instructor and made it more accesible. I accomplished this by adding more descriptive semantic tags to the file with the hopes of improving navigation for anyone who may read the file afterwards. Next, I made sure that all of the links on the HTML was working properly so that when you click on them, they would direct you to the correct part of the screen. Lastly, I went through the CSS file to get rid of any repeated/ unneccessary code, put all of the elements in sequential order, and commented on the page to inform the reader on what each line of code is for.
